Haskell Code and Text Blogging (HaCoTeB)
========================================

A. About
........

Haskell Code and Text Blogging (HaCoTeB) started as a tool which allowed easy
posting of Wordpress.com blog posts containing text and source code without
relying to online tools or other plugins.

It was intended to transform one single input file into a html fragment to be
inserted into the blog editor. However, in time, I've decided to allow patches
which will allow converting the same input file into another format, for
example into a RST format or a PDF file.
